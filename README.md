# Snake_Game
This project is a simple Snake Game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game consists of a grid-based board where a snake moves around, grows in length when it eats food, and avoids running into the grid boundaries or itself. Key components of the project include:

1. HTML for structuring the game board.
2. CSS for styling the game board and snake.
3. JavaScript for the game logic, including snake movement, food generation, and collision detection.

The main game loop updates the snake's position, checks for collisions, and renders the game state at a consistent speed.
